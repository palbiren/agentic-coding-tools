# Iterate on Plan

Iteratively refine an OpenSpec proposal after `/plan-feature` creates it. Each iteration reviews the proposal documents, identifies plan quality issues, implements fixes, and commits — repeating until only low-criticality findings remain or max iterations are reached.

## Arguments

`$ARGUMENTS` - OpenSpec change-id (required), optionally followed by `--max <N>` (default: 3) and `--threshold <level>` (default: "medium"; values: "critical", "high", "medium", "low")

## Prerequisites

- OpenSpec proposal exists at `openspec/changes/<change-id>/` with at least proposal.md, tasks.md, and one spec delta
- Run `/plan-feature` first if no proposal exists
- Proposal has NOT yet been approved (this skill refines before approval)

## OpenSpec Execution Preference

Use OpenSpec-generated runtime assets first, then CLI fallback:
- Claude: `.claude/commands/opsx/*.md` or `.claude/skills/openspec-*/SKILL.md`
- Codex: `.codex/skills/openspec-*/SKILL.md`
- Gemini: `.gemini/commands/opsx/*.toml` or `.gemini/skills/openspec-*/SKILL.md`
- Fallback: direct `openspec` CLI commands

## Coordinator Integration (Optional)

Use `docs/coordination-detection-template.md` as the shared detection preamble.

- Detect transport and capability flags at skill start
- Execute hooks only when the matching `CAN_*` flag is `true`
- If coordinator is unavailable, continue with standalone behavior

## Steps

### 0. Detect Coordinator, Read Handoff, Recall Memory

At skill start, run the coordination detection preamble and set:

- `COORDINATOR_AVAILABLE`
- `COORDINATION_TRANSPORT` (`mcp|http|none`)
- `CAN_LOCK`, `CAN_QUEUE_WORK`, `CAN_HANDOFF`, `CAN_MEMORY`, `CAN_GUARDRAILS`

If `CAN_HANDOFF=true`, read recent handoff context:

- MCP path: `read_handoff`
- HTTP path: `"<skill-base-dir>/../coordination-bridge/scripts/coordination_bridge.py"` `try_handoff_read(...)`

If `CAN_MEMORY=true`, recall relevant plan-iteration memories:

- MCP path: `recall`
- HTTP path: `"<skill-base-dir>/../coordination-bridge/scripts/coordination_bridge.py"` `try_recall(...)`

On recall/handoff failure, continue with standalone iteration and log informationally.

### 1. Determine Change ID and Configuration

```bash
# Parse change-id from argument
CHANGE_ID=${ARGUMENTS%% *}

# Defaults
MAX_ITERATIONS=3
THRESHOLD="medium"  # critical > high > medium > low
```

Parse optional flags from `$ARGUMENTS`:
- `--max <N>` overrides MAX_ITERATIONS
- `--threshold <level>` overrides THRESHOLD

### 2. Verify Proposal Exists

```bash
# Verify proposal exists
openspec show $CHANGE_ID

# Verify core files exist
ls openspec/changes/$CHANGE_ID/proposal.md
ls openspec/changes/$CHANGE_ID/tasks.md
ls openspec/changes/$CHANGE_ID/specs/
```

If any core files are missing, abort and recommend running `/plan-feature` first.

### 3. Run Baseline Validation

```bash
# Strict validation as starting point
openspec validate $CHANGE_ID --strict
```

Record any validation failures. These become automatic critical-level findings in the first iteration.

### 3.5. Prepare Findings Artifact

Preferred path:
- Use the runtime-native continue/findings workflow (`opsx:continue` equivalent) to create or extend `plan-findings`.

CLI fallback path:

```bash
openspec instructions plan-findings --change "$CHANGE_ID"
openspec status --change "$CHANGE_ID"
```

Ensure `openspec/changes/<change-id>/plan-findings.md` exists and append each iteration's findings there.

### 4. Begin Iteration Loop

```
ITERATION=1
```

---

### 5. Review and Analyze (Parallel Analysis Option)

Read all proposal documents to understand intent and current quality. For complex proposals, use parallel Task(Explore) agents to analyze different quality dimensions:

**Sequential approach (default for simple proposals):**
- Read `openspec/changes/<change-id>/proposal.md`
- Read `openspec/changes/<change-id>/tasks.md`
- Read `openspec/changes/<change-id>/design.md` (if exists)
- Read all spec deltas in `openspec/changes/<change-id>/specs/*/spec.md`
- Read existing specs in `openspec/specs/` for capabilities referenced in the proposal's Impact section

**Parallel approach (for complex proposals with 5+ tasks or 3+ spec deltas):**
```
# Launch parallel analysis agents (single message, multiple Task calls)
Task(subagent_type="Explore", prompt="Analyze openspec/changes/$CHANGE_ID/ for COMPLETENESS issues: missing requirements, unaddressed edge cases, gaps in impact analysis, requirements without scenarios", run_in_background=true)
Task(subagent_type="Explore", prompt="Analyze openspec/changes/$CHANGE_ID/ for CLARITY and CONSISTENCY issues: ambiguous wording, vague scenarios, contradictions between documents", run_in_background=true)
Task(subagent_type="Explore", prompt="Analyze openspec/changes/$CHANGE_ID/tasks.md for FEASIBILITY and PARALLELIZABILITY: task size, dependencies, file overlap that would cause merge conflicts", run_in_background=true)
Task(subagent_type="Explore", prompt="Analyze openspec/changes/$CHANGE_ID/ for TESTABILITY: scenarios that can't be verified, subjective language like 'properly' or 'correctly'", run_in_background=true)
```

**Analysis Synthesis:**
1. Wait for all TaskOutput results (if parallel)
2. Merge findings, deduplicate, and assign criticality levels
3. Produce the structured plan analysis below

Produce a **structured plan analysis** with findings in this format:

| # | Type | Criticality | Description | Proposed Fix |
|---|------|-------------|-------------|--------------|
| 1 | completeness/clarity/feasibility/scope/consistency/testability/parallelizability | critical/high/medium/low | What the issue is | How to fix it |

**Type categories:**
- **completeness**: Missing requirements, unaddressed edge cases, gaps in impact analysis, missing spec deltas for affected capabilities, requirements without scenarios
- **clarity**: Ambiguous requirement wording, vague WHEN/THEN scenarios, unclear task descriptions, missing context in proposal.md Why section, requirements not using SHALL/MUST
- **feasibility**: Tasks too large to implement atomically, unrealistic scope, missing technical constraints, undocumented dependencies between tasks
- **scope**: Scope creep beyond stated goals, mixing unrelated concerns, non-goals that should be explicit, tasks that don't trace back to any requirement
- **consistency**: Contradictions between proposal.md and design.md, requirement wording mismatches across documents, affected specs listed in Impact but no corresponding delta (or vice versa), duplicate requirements
- **testability**: Scenarios that can't be verified, requirements without measurable acceptance criteria, WHEN/THEN using subjective language ("properly", "correctly", "as expected")
- **parallelizability**: How well the task decomposition supports parallel multi-agent execution via `/parallel-implement`. Evaluates whether tasks have explicit dependency declarations, whether task scopes are isolated to separate modules/files (no shared-file overlap that would cause merge conflicts), whether tasks are granular enough for independent agent assignment, and whether sequencing maximizes concurrent execution width

**Criticality levels:**
- **critical**: `openspec validate --strict` failures, missing spec deltas for capabilities listed in Impact, requirements without any scenarios, proposal.md missing required sections (Why, What Changes, Impact)
- **high**: Ambiguous requirements that could be implemented multiple valid ways, tasks not traceable to requirements, scenarios using subjective/unmeasurable criteria, contradictions between documents, tasks with implicit shared-state or shared-file dependencies that would cause merge conflicts if parallelized
- **medium**: Missing edge-case scenarios (only success path covered), tasks too coarse for single-commit implementation, design.md needed but absent, incomplete impact analysis, tasks missing explicit dependency annotations, tasks that could be split into independent units for better parallelism
- **low**: Wording polish, minor formatting, task ordering optimization for parallel execution, optional design.md sections

**Plan smells to check for:**
- Giant task (spans multiple systems or modules)
- Orphan requirement (requirement in spec delta with no corresponding task)
- Orphan task (task with no corresponding requirement)
- Vague scenario (WHEN/THEN using words like "appropriate", "correctly", "properly", "as expected")
- Missing failure path (only success scenarios, no error/edge-case scenarios)
- Scope leak (tasks or requirements that extend beyond the stated What Changes)
- Impact mismatch (affected specs listed in proposal.md but no spec delta created, or vice versa)
- Design gap (multiple complex decisions without a design.md)
- Implicit dependency (tasks that modify the same files or shared state without explicit ordering — would cause merge conflicts in parallel execution)
- Monolithic task (single task that could be decomposed into independent subtasks for parallel agents)
- Missing dependency graph (tasks lack explicit dependency annotations needed by `/parallel-implement` and Beads `--blocked-by`)
- Coupled scope (tasks that modify overlapping files or modules, preventing isolated worktree execution)

### 6. Check Termination Conditions

**Stop iterating if:**
- All findings are below the criticality threshold → present summary and list remaining low-criticality findings for optional manual review
- ITERATION > MAX_ITERATIONS → present summary and list any unaddressed findings

**If stopping**, skip to the **After Loop** section below.

**Otherwise**, continue to step 7.

### 7. Implement Improvements

Fix all findings at or above the criticality threshold by modifying the proposal documents:

- **proposal.md**: Add missing Why context, expand What Changes, correct Impact section
- **tasks.md**: Split giant tasks, add missing tasks for orphan requirements, add explicit ordering and dependency notes, improve verifiability, restructure for parallel execution where possible
- **design.md**: Create if needed (per criteria below), add missing decision rationale, document alternatives considered, add risks/trade-offs
- **Spec deltas**: Add missing requirements, add WHEN/THEN scenarios for uncovered paths, fix requirement wording to use SHALL/MUST, add failure/edge-case scenarios, split monolithic spec files

**When to create design.md** (if one does not exist):
- Change affects multiple capabilities or introduces a new pattern
- New external dependency or significant data model changes
- Security, performance, or migration concerns
- Multiple technical decisions that need documented rationale

For findings that are outside the scope of the current proposal:
- Flag as "out of scope"
- Recommend creating a new OpenSpec proposal
- Do NOT expand the current proposal to address them

### 8. Run Quality Checks

```bash
# Validate proposal structure
openspec validate $CHANGE_ID --strict
```

Additionally verify:
- **Scenario coverage**: Every requirement has at least one success and one failure/edge scenario
- **Requirement completeness**: All requirements use SHALL/MUST, all have clear subjects
- **Task granularity**: Each task could reasonably be completed in a single commit
- **Task traceability**: Every task maps to at least one requirement, every requirement maps to at least one task
- **Cross-document consistency**: Impact section matches actual spec deltas, proposal.md describes all spec delta changes
- **Design rationale**: If design.md exists, each decision has at least one alternative considered
- **Parallelizability**: Every task either (a) is independent (no shared files/state with other tasks) or (b) has explicit dependency annotation. Produce a dependency graph summary:
  - `Independent: N tasks | Sequential chains: M | Max parallel width: W`
  - Identify tasks that modify the same files — these need explicit sequencing or scope restructuring to avoid merge conflicts during `/parallel-implement`
  - If all tasks are purely sequential with no parallelism possible, flag as medium finding

Fix any failures before proceeding. If fixes introduce new issues, address them within this iteration.

### 9. Commit Iteration

```bash
# Review all changes
git status
git diff

# Stage proposal document changes only
git add openspec/changes/$CHANGE_ID/

# Commit with structured message
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
refine(plan): iteration <N> - <summary of key changes>

Iterate-on-plan: <change-id>, iteration <N>/<max>

Findings addressed:
- [<criticality>] <type>: <description>
- [<criticality>] <type>: <description>

Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>
EOF
)"

# Increment and loop
ITERATION=$((ITERATION + 1))
```

**Loop back to Step 5.**

---

## After Loop

Present a summary of all iterations:

```

If `CAN_MEMORY=true`, remember iteration outcomes (for example findings counts, key fixes, and residual risks):

- MCP path: `remember`
- HTTP path: `"<skill-base-dir>/../coordination-bridge/scripts/coordination_bridge.py"` `try_remember(...)`

If `CAN_HANDOFF=true`, write a completion handoff containing:

- Iterations performed and findings addressed
- Remaining below-threshold findings (if any)
- Validation status and proposal readiness
- Recommended next command
## Plan Iteration Summary

### Iteration 1
- Findings: <count> (<count by criticality>)
- Fixed: <list>

### Iteration 2
- Findings: <count> (<count by criticality>)
- Fixed: <list>

...

### Final State
- Total iterations: <N>
- Total findings addressed: <count>
- Remaining findings (below threshold): <list or "none">
- Termination reason: <threshold met | max iterations reached>
- Validation status: <openspec validate --strict result>

### Parallelizability Assessment
- Independent tasks: <N>
- Sequential chains: <M>
- Max parallel width: <W>
- File overlap conflicts: <list or "none">

### Proposal Readiness

## Workflow

Unified skills with **tiered execution** — each skill auto-selects its tier at startup based on coordinator availability and feature complexity:

| Tier | When | Planning Artifacts | Execution |
|------|------|-------------------|-----------|
| **Coordinated** | Coordinator available | Contracts + work-packages + resource claims | Multi-agent DAG via coordinator |
| **Local parallel** | No coordinator, complex feature | Contracts + work-packages (no claims) | DAG via built-in Agent parallelism |
| **Sequential** | Simple feature | Tasks.md only | Single-agent sequential |

```
/explore-feature [focus-area] (optional)               → Candidate shortlist for next work
/plan-feature <description>                            → Proposal approval gate
  /iterate-on-plan <change-id> (optional)              → Refines plan before approval
  /parallel-review-plan <change-id> (optional)         → Independent plan review (vendor-diverse)
/implement-feature <change-id>                         → PR review gate (runs spec + evidence validation)
  /iterate-on-implementation <change-id> (optional)    → Refinement complete
  /parallel-review-implementation <change-id> (optional) → Per-package review (vendor-diverse)
/cleanup-feature <change-id>                           → Done (runs deploy + security validation before merge)
```

Validation is automatic: `/implement-feature` runs environment-safe checks (spec, evidence), `/cleanup-feature` and `/merge-pull-requests` run Docker-dependent checks (deploy, smoke, security, E2E) before merge. Both delegate to `/validate-feature` with `--phase` selectors. `/validate-feature` can also be invoked directly for a full manual pass.

Old `linear-*` and `parallel-*` prefixed names are accepted as trigger aliases (e.g., "parallel plan feature" triggers `/plan-feature` with at least local-parallel tier).

### Infrastructure Skills

- **`coordination-bridge`** — Coordinator detection (`check_coordinator.py`) and HTTP fallback bridge
- **`parallel-infrastructure`** — Shared parallel execution scripts: DAG scheduler, review dispatcher, consensus synthesizer, scope checker
- **`validate-feature`** — Validation phases (spec, evidence, deploy, smoke, security, e2e); called by implement-feature, cleanup-feature, and merge-pull-requests with `--phase` selectors
- **`parallel-review-plan`** / **`parallel-review-implementation`** — Vendor-diverse review utilities (used by implement-feature and auto-dev-loop)

See [Parallel Agentic Development](docs/parallel-agentic-development.md) for the full implementation reference.

## Python Environment

- **uv for all Python environments**: Use `uv` (not pip, pipenv, or poetry) for dependency management and virtual environments across all Python projects. CI uses `astral-sh/setup-uv@v5`.
- **agent-coordinator**: `cd agent-coordinator && uv sync --all-extras` to install. Venv at `agent-coordinator/.venv`.
- **skills (infrastructure)**: `cd skills && uv sync --all-extras` to install. Venv at `skills/.venv`. Covers worktree, validation, architecture, and other infrastructure skill scripts.
- **Running tools**: Activate the relevant venv first (`source .venv/bin/activate`) or use the venv's Python directly (e.g., `skills/.venv/bin/python -m pytest`).

## Git Conventions

- **Branch naming**: `openspec/<change-id>` for OpenSpec-driven features
- **Commit format**: Reference the OpenSpec change-id in commit messages
- **PR template**: Include link to `openspec/changes/<change-id>/proposal.md`
- **Push plan refinement commits promptly**: `/iterate-on-plan` commits to local main. Push these to remote before other PRs merge, or they cause divergence during `/cleanup-feature`. Alternatively, make plan refinements on the feature branch.
- **Rebase ours/theirs inversion**: During `git rebase`, `--ours` = the branch being rebased ONTO (upstream), `--theirs` = the commit being replayed. This is the opposite of `git merge`. When resolving rebase conflicts to keep upstream, use `git checkout --ours`.

## Worktree Management

- **Launcher invariant**: The shared checkout is **read-only**. Every skill that modifies git state (plan, implement, cleanup) MUST work in a worktree, never the shared checkout. This prevents conflicts when multiple agents run from the same directory.
- **Location**: `.git-worktrees/<change-id>/` for single-agent, `.git-worktrees/<change-id>/<agent-id>/` for parallel
- **Registry**: `.git-worktrees/.registry.json` tracks owner, branch, heartbeat, pin status
- **Commands**: `python3 skills/worktree/scripts/worktree.py setup|teardown|status|detect|heartbeat|list|pin|unpin|gc`
- **Merge**: `python3 skills/worktree/scripts/merge_worktrees.py <change-id> <pkg-id>...` merges package branches into feature branch
- **Agent-id**: Pass `--agent-id` for parallel disambiguation. Omit for single-agent (backward compatible)
- **Pin**: Use `pin` to protect worktrees from GC during overnight pauses or waiting on input
- **GC**: Default 24h stale threshold. Pinned worktrees survive GC unless `--force`
- **Branch naming**: Agent branches use `--` separator: `openspec/<change-id>--<agent-id>`. Git cannot have both `refs/heads/a/b` and `refs/heads/a/b/c`, so `/` between change-id and agent-id would conflict with the feature branch `openspec/<change-id>`.
- **Rule**: One agent, one worktree, one branch. Never share a worktree between agents

### Sync-Point Skills

Some skills operate directly on the shared checkout / main branch rather than in worktrees. These are **sync-point skills** — convergence operations that integrate work back into main.

| Skill | Why main is safe |
|---|---|
| `/merge-pull-requests` | User-invoked merge of approved PRs; inherently sequential |
| `/update-specs` | Post-merge documentation commit; no concurrent conflict risk |
| `/cleanup-feature` | Uses a worktree internally but touches main at the end |

**Contract for sync-point skills:**
- **Exclusive access**: Must not run while other agents hold active worktrees. Use `shared.check_no_active_agents()` to verify before proceeding.
- **User-invoked only**: Never triggered automatically by the coordinator or other skills.
- **Dirty-state check**: Must verify the working directory is clean before touching main.
- **`--force` escape hatch**: Allow the user to override the active-agent guard when they know it's safe (e.g., stale registry entries from crashed agents).

The active-agent guard checks `.git-worktrees/.registry.json` for non-stale entries (heartbeat within the last hour). If active agents are found, it aborts with guidance on how to proceed.

## Parallel Modification Zones

*Data source: [parallel_zones.json](parallel_zones.json)*

**760 independent groups** identified. The largest interconnected group has 262 modules; 956 modules are leaf nodes (safe to modify in isolation).

**24 high-impact modules** act as coupling points — parallel changes touching these need coordination.

### Interconnected Groups

**Group 0** (262 members spanning 31 modules): `agents_config`, `approval`, `audit`, `config`, `coordination_api`, `coordination_cli`, `coordination_mcp`, `db`
  ... and 23 more modules

**Group 1** (29 members spanning 29 modules): `agents_config`, `approval`, `audit`, `config`, `coordination_api`, `coordination_cli`, `coordination_mcp`, `db`
  ... and 21 more modules

**Group 2** (14 members spanning 1 modules): `notifications`

**Group 3** (9 members spanning 1 modules): `db_postgres`

**Group 4** (6 members spanning 1 modules): `docker_manager`

**Group 5** (5 members spanning 4 modules): `approval`, `locks`, `merge_queue`, `session_grants`

**Group 6** (4 members spanning 3 modules): `discovery`, `feature_registry`, `work_queue`

**Group 7** (2 members spanning 2 modules): `network_policies`, `policy_engine`

**Group 8** (2 members spanning 1 modules): `port_allocator`

**Group 9** (2 members spanning 2 modules): `telemetry`, `work_queue`

### Leaf Modules (956)

956 modules have no dependents — changes are fully isolated. 750 of the 760 groups are singletons.

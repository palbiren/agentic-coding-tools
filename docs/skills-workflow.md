# Skills Workflow

A structured feature development workflow for AI-assisted coding. Skills are reusable Claude Code slash commands that guide features from proposal through implementation to completion, with human approval gates at each stage.

## Overview

The workflow breaks feature development into discrete stages, each handled by a dedicated skill. Every stage ends at a natural approval gate where a human reviews and approves before the next stage begins. This design supports asynchronous workflows where an AI agent can do focused work, then hand off for review.

## Skill Families

Two skill families exist: **linear** (sequential, single-agent) and **parallel** (multi-agent, DAG-scheduled). Both share the same OpenSpec artifact structure. The core workflow skills have been renamed to `linear-*`; original names (`/explore-feature`, `/plan-feature`, etc.) are backward-compatible aliases.

### Linear Skills (default)

Sequential feature development with one agent per phase:

```
/linear-explore-feature [focus-area]                   Candidate feature shortlist
/linear-plan-feature <description>                     Proposal approval gate
  /linear-iterate-on-plan <change-id> (optional)       Refines plan before approval
/linear-implement-feature <change-id>                  PR review gate
  /linear-iterate-on-implementation <change-id>        Refinement complete
  /linear-validate-feature <change-id> (optional)      Live deployment verification
/linear-cleanup-feature <change-id>                    Done
```

### Parallel Skills (requires coordinator)

Multi-agent feature development with contract-first design and DAG-scheduled work packages:

```
/parallel-explore-feature [focus-area]                 Candidate shortlist + resource claim analysis
/parallel-plan-feature <description>                   Contracts + work-packages.yaml
  /parallel-review-plan <change-id>                    Independent plan review (vendor-diverse)
/parallel-implement-feature <change-id>                DAG-scheduled multi-agent implementation
  /parallel-review-implementation <change-id>          Per-package review (vendor-diverse)
/parallel-validate-feature <change-id>                 Evidence completeness + integration checks
/parallel-cleanup-feature <change-id>                  Merge queue + cross-feature rebase
```

See [Two-Level Parallel Development](two-level-parallel-agentic-development.md) for the full design.

## Prerequisites

- OpenSpec CLI installed (v1.0+): `npm install -g @fission-ai/openspec`
- Repository initialized for OpenSpec (once per repo): `openspec init`
- Validate environment before running workflow skills:
  - `openspec list`
  - `openspec list --specs`

```
/linear-plan-feature <description>                     Proposal approval gate
  /linear-iterate-on-plan <change-id> (optional)       Refines plan before approval
/linear-implement-feature <change-id>                  PR review gate
  /linear-iterate-on-implementation <change-id>        Refinement complete
  /refresh-architecture [mode] (optional)              Regenerate/validate architecture artifacts
  /linear-validate-feature <change-id> (optional)      Live deployment verification (includes security scanning)
/linear-cleanup-feature <change-id>                    Done
```

Optional discovery stage before planning:

```
/linear-explore-feature [focus-area]                   Candidate feature shortlist
/refresh-architecture (optional)                       Fresh architecture context for planning
```

Architecture refresh callout:
- Default path: run `/refresh-architecture` before `/plan-feature` if `docs/architecture-analysis/` is stale, missing, or after substantial structural changes.
- Advanced modes: run `/refresh-architecture --validate` after `/implement-feature` or `/iterate-on-implementation`, and `/refresh-architecture --diff <base-sha>` before `/validate-feature`.

## Step Dependencies

| Step | Depends On | Unblocks |
|---|---|---|

## Artifact Flow By Step

| Step | Consumes | Produces/Updates |

| `/cleanup-feature` | PR state + `tasks.md` completion | Archived change (`openspec/changes/archive/...`), updated `openspec/specs/`, optional `openspec/changes/<id>/deferred-tasks.md` prior to archive |

## OpenSpec 1.0 Integration

High-level workflow skills stay stable, but their internals follow this precedence:

1. Agent-native OpenSpec assets for the active runtime
2. Direct `openspec` CLI fallback

Runtime asset locations:
- Claude: `.claude/commands/opsx/*.md`, `.claude/skills/openspec-*/SKILL.md`
- Codex: `.codex/skills/openspec-*/SKILL.md`
- Gemini: `.gemini/commands/opsx/*.toml`, `.gemini/skills/openspec-*/SKILL.md`

Cross-agent mapping parity:

| Intent | Claude | Codex | Gemini |
|---|---|---|---|
| Plan (new/ff) | `new`, `ff` | `openspec-new-change`, `openspec-ff-change` | `new`, `ff` |
| Continue/findings | `continue` | `openspec-continue-change` | `continue` |
| Apply | `apply` | `openspec-apply-change` | `apply` |
| Verify | `verify` | `openspec-verify-change` | `verify` |
| Archive | `archive` | `openspec-archive-change` | `archive` |
| Sync | `sync` | `openspec-sync-specs` (alias of sync intent) | `sync` |

CLI fallback commands:
- `openspec new change`
- `openspec status --change <id>`
- `openspec instructions <artifact|apply> --change <id>`
- `openspec archive <id> --yes`

## Coordinator Integration Model

### Canonical Skill Distribution

`skills/` is the source of truth for workflow skill content.

Runtime skill trees are synced mirrors:

- `.claude/skills/`
- `.codex/skills/`
- `.gemini/skills/`

Use the existing rsync workflow (no alternate distribution path):

```bash
skills/install.sh --mode rsync --agents claude,codex,gemini --deps none --python-tools none
```

After sync, any drift between canonical and runtime mirrors is a parity defect.

### Transport and Capability Flags

Integrated skills use a shared preamble (`docs/coordination-detection-template.md`) and set:

- `COORDINATOR_AVAILABLE`
- `COORDINATION_TRANSPORT` (`mcp|http|none`)
- `CAN_LOCK`
- `CAN_QUEUE_WORK`
- `CAN_HANDOFF`
- `CAN_MEMORY`
- `CAN_GUARDRAILS`

Transport model:

- CLI runtimes: MCP detection by tool availability
- Web/Cloud runtimes: HTTP detection via `skills/coordination-bridge/scripts/coordination_bridge.py`
- No coordinator: fallback to standalone skill behavior

Hook execution is capability-gated: a hook runs only when its `CAN_*` flag is true.

### Explicit Runtime Parity Tests (3 Providers x 2 Transports)

Run these checks before marking coordinator skill integration ready.

#### Preflight: canonical sync and mirror consistency

```bash
skills/install.sh --mode rsync --agents claude,codex,gemini --deps none --python-tools none
```

Verify representative integrated skills match canonical content:

```bash
for skill in linear-explore-feature linear-plan-feature linear-implement-feature linear-iterate-on-plan linear-iterate-on-implementation linear-validate-feature linear-cleanup-feature security-review setup-coordinator; do
  diff -u "skills/$skill/SKILL.md" ".claude/skills/$skill/SKILL.md"
  diff -u "skills/$skill/SKILL.md" ".codex/skills/$skill/SKILL.md"
  diff -u "skills/$skill/SKILL.md" ".gemini/skills/$skill/SKILL.md"
done
```

#### MCP matrix (local CLI)

Run once per runtime:

1. Claude Codex CLI + MCP
2. Codex CLI + MCP
3. Gemini CLI + MCP

Assertions per runtime:

- Detection resolves `COORDINATION_TRANSPORT=mcp`
- `CAN_*` flags reflect exposed MCP tools
- `/implement-feature` only runs lock/queue/guardrail hooks when corresponding flags are true
- `/plan-feature` or `/iterate-on-plan` only runs handoff hooks when `CAN_HANDOFF=true`
- `/validate-feature` and `/iterate-on-*` only runs memory hooks when `CAN_MEMORY=true`

#### HTTP matrix (Web/Cloud)

Run once per runtime:

1. Claude Web + HTTP API
2. Codex Cloud/Web + HTTP API
3. Gemini Web/Cloud + HTTP API

Baseline HTTP assertion command:

```bash
python3 skills/coordination-bridge/scripts/coordination_bridge.py detect --http-url "$COORDINATION_API_URL" --api-key "$COORDINATION_API_KEY"
```

Assertions per runtime:

- Detection resolves `COORDINATION_TRANSPORT=http`
- Bridge capability flags match reachable HTTP endpoints (including partial capability cases)
- Integrated skill hooks honor capability gating
- Guardrail violations are informational in phase 1 and do not hard-block execution

#### Degraded fallback matrix (both transports)

For each of the six runtime dimensions above, simulate coordinator unavailability:

- MCP unavailable (disable coordinator MCP server/tools)
- HTTP unavailable (bad URL, network block, or invalid API key)

Expected behavior:

- Detection resolves `COORDINATION_TRANSPORT=none` and/or `COORDINATOR_AVAILABLE=false` as appropriate
- Skills continue standalone flow without coordinator-induced hard failure
- HTTP bridge helpers return `status="skipped"` for unavailable operations
- Lock cleanup/release paths remain best-effort and non-fatal

## Core Skills

### `/explore-feature`

Identifies what to build next using architecture diagnostics, active OpenSpec state, and codebase risk/opportunity signals (for example refactoring candidates, usability improvements, performance/cost opportunities).

**Method**:
- Scores opportunities with a weighted model (`impact`, `strategic-fit`, `effort`, `risk`) for reproducible ranking
- Buckets results into `quick-win` and `big-bet`
- Captures explicit `blocked-by` dependencies per candidate
- Uses recommendation history to avoid repeatedly surfacing unchanged deferred work

**Produces**:
- Ranked feature shortlist and one concrete recommendation to start with `/plan-feature`
- `docs/feature-discovery/opportunities.json` (machine-readable current ranking)
- `docs/feature-discovery/history.json` (recommendation history for future prioritization)

**Gate**: None (discovery/support step).

### `/plan-feature`

Creates an [OpenSpec](https://github.com/fission-ai/openspec) proposal for a new feature. The skill gathers context from existing specs and code using parallel exploration agents, then scaffolds a complete proposal with requirements, tasks, and spec deltas using runtime-native OpenSpec assets first and CLI fallback second.

**Produces**: `openspec/changes/<change-id>/` containing `proposal.md`, `tasks.md`, `design.md`, and spec deltas in `specs/`

**Gate**: Proposal approval — the human reviews the proposal before implementation begins.

### `/iterate-on-plan`

Refines an OpenSpec proposal through structured iteration. Each iteration reviews the proposal documents, identifies quality issues across seven dimensions (completeness, clarity, feasibility, scope, consistency, testability, parallelizability), implements fixes, and commits. Repeats until only low-criticality findings remain or max iterations (default: 3) are reached.

**Produces**: Iteration commits improving proposal documents, a parallelizability assessment, and a proposal readiness checklist.

**Gate**: Same as `/plan-feature` — the refined proposal still needs human approval.

### `/implement-feature`

Implements an approved proposal using a test-driven approach. First generates a `change-context.md` traceability matrix mapping spec requirements to planned tests (Phase 1 — TDD RED), then implements code to make tests pass (Phase 2 — TDD GREEN). Works through tasks sequentially or in parallel (for independent tasks with no file overlap), runs quality checks (pytest, mypy, ruff, openspec validate), and creates a PR. Uses runtime-native apply guidance first and `openspec instructions apply` as fallback.

**Produces**: Feature branch `openspec/<change-id>`, `change-context.md` (traceability skeleton with code mapping), passing tests, and a PR ready for review.

**Gate**: PR review — the human reviews the implementation before merge.

### `/iterate-on-implementation`

Refines a feature implementation through structured iteration. Each iteration reviews the code against the proposal, identifies improvements (bugs, edge cases, workflow issues, performance, UX), implements fixes, and commits. Supports parallel fixes for findings targeting different files. Also updates OpenSpec documents if spec drift is detected.

**Produces**: Iteration commits on the feature branch with structured findings summaries.

**Gate**: Same as `/implement-feature` — the refined PR still needs human review.

### `/validate-feature`

Deploys the feature locally with DEBUG logging and runs seven validation phases:

1. **Deploy** — Starts services via docker-compose
2. **Smoke** — Verifies health endpoints, auth enforcement, CORS, error sanitization, and security headers
3. **Security** — Runs OWASP Dependency-Check and ZAP against the live deployment (non-critical; degrades gracefully if prerequisites missing)
4. **E2E** — Runs Playwright end-to-end tests (if available)
5. **Architecture** — Validates architecture flows against changed files
6. **Spec Compliance** — Populates evidence in `change-context.md` by verifying each requirement against the live system (Phase 3 of the traceability matrix)
7. **Log Analysis** — Scans logs for warnings, errors, stack traces, and deprecation notices

Also checks CI/CD status via GitHub CLI. Produces a structured validation report (which references `change-context.md` for spec compliance details), security scanner outputs, and architecture-impact artifact, persists them to the change directory, and posts report results to the PR.

**Produces**: `openspec/changes/<change-id>/validation-report.md`, `openspec/changes/<change-id>/change-context.md` (evidence populated), `openspec/changes/<change-id>/architecture-impact.md`, and a PR comment.

**Gate**: Validation results — the human decides whether to proceed to cleanup or address findings.

### `/security-review`

Runs a reusable cross-project security gate with project profile detection and pluggable scanners. Supports OWASP Dependency-Check and ZAP container adapters (Podman/Desktop or Docker-compatible runtime), normalizes findings, and computes a deterministic `PASS`/`FAIL`/`INCONCLUSIVE` decision from a configurable threshold.

Security scanning is also available inline as a phase within `/validate-feature`, which is the recommended path for feature development workflows (ZAP benefits from the live deployment). Use `/security-review` standalone for ad-hoc scans, CI pipelines, or when you need security scanning without full validation.

**Produces**: canonical report outputs under `docs/security-review/` and optionally `openspec/changes/<change-id>/security-review-report.md`.

**Gate**: Security gate result — the human decides whether to remediate findings.

### `/cleanup-feature`

Merges the approved PR, migrates any open tasks (to Beads issues or a follow-up OpenSpec proposal), archives the proposal via runtime-native archive guidance or CLI fallback, and cleans up branches.

**Produces**: Merged PR, archived proposal in `openspec/changes/archive/<change-id>/`, updated specs in `openspec/specs/`.

**Gate**: None — this is the final mechanical step.

## Supporting Skills

### `/refresh-architecture`

Regenerates, validates, or inspects `docs/architecture-analysis/` artifacts that describe code structure, cross-layer flows, and safe parallel modification zones.

**Modes**:
- Full refresh: `make architecture`
- Validate only: `make architecture-validate`
- Views only: `make architecture-views`
- Report only: `make architecture-report`
- Diff to baseline: `make architecture-diff BASE_SHA=<sha>`
- Feature slice: `make architecture-feature FEATURE="<files>"`

**Produces**: Updated architecture artifacts in `docs/architecture-analysis/` for planning context, implementation safety checks, and validation/reporting.

**Gate**: None (support/verification step).

### `/merge-pull-requests`

Triages, reviews, and merges open PRs from multiple sources: OpenSpec feature PRs, Jules automation PRs, Codex PRs, Dependabot/Renovate PRs, and manual PRs. Includes staleness detection and review comment analysis.

### `/prioritize-proposals`

Analyzes all active OpenSpec proposals against recent commit history. Produces a prioritized "what to do next" report optimized for minimal file conflicts and parallel agent work. Detects proposals that may already be addressed by recent commits or need refinement due to code drift.

### `/update-specs`

Updates OpenSpec spec files to reflect what was actually built. Used after implementation work where debugging, testing, code review, or interactive refinements revealed differences between the original spec and the final implementation.

### `/openspec-beads-worktree`

Coordinates OpenSpec proposals with Beads task tracking and isolated git worktree execution. Implements systematic spec-driven development with parallel agent coordination.

### `/bug-scrub`

Performs a comprehensive project health check by collecting signals from CI tools (pytest, ruff, mypy, openspec validate), existing reports (architecture diagnostics, security review), deferred OpenSpec issues, and code markers (TODO/FIXME/HACK/XXX). Aggregates all findings into a unified schema and produces a prioritized report.

**Method**:
- Runs signal collectors in parallel, each producing normalized `Finding` objects
- Aggregates, sorts by severity/age, and generates actionable recommendations
- Reports committed to `docs/bug-scrub/` for cross-agent access

**Produces**: `docs/bug-scrub/bug-scrub-report.md` (human-readable) and `docs/bug-scrub/bug-scrub-report.json` (machine-readable for `/fix-scrub`).

**Gate**: None (diagnostic/support step).

### `/fix-scrub`

Consumes the bug-scrub report and applies remediation. Classifies findings into three fixability tiers: auto (tool-native fixes like `ruff --fix`), agent (Task()-dispatched code fixes with file scope isolation), and manual (reported but not fixed). Runs quality verification after fixes and tracks OpenSpec task completions.

**Method**:
- Classifies findings → plans by file scope → applies auto-fixes → dispatches agent-fixes → verifies quality → commits
- Updates `tasks.md` checkboxes when deferred findings are resolved

**Produces**: `docs/bug-scrub/fix-scrub-report.md` with tier breakdown, files changed, tasks completed, and manual action items.

**Gate**: None — but prompts user before committing if regressions are detected.

**Workflow pair**: Run `/bug-scrub` first (diagnosis), then `/fix-scrub` (remediation).

## Design Principles

### Skills map to approval gates

Each skill ends at a natural handoff point where human approval is needed. `/plan-feature` stops at proposal approval, `/implement-feature` stops at PR review. This creates clean boundaries between AI work and human oversight.

### Creative and mechanical work are separated

Planning and implementation are creative work requiring judgment. Cleanup and archival are mechanical. Separating them into different skills allows the mechanical steps to be delegated or automated with higher confidence.

### Iteration happens at both creative stages

Both proposals and implementations benefit from structured refinement. `/iterate-on-plan` catches quality issues before implementation begins, while `/iterate-on-implementation` catches bugs and edge cases before PR review. Each uses domain-specific finding types and quality checks.

### Parallel execution is first-class

Task decomposition in proposals explicitly identifies dependencies and maximizes independent work units. The `Task()` tool with `run_in_background=true` enables concurrent agents without worktrees. File scope isolation via prompts prevents merge conflicts — each agent's prompt lists exactly which files it may modify.

### All planning flows through OpenSpec

Every non-trivial feature starts with an [OpenSpec](https://github.com/fission-ai/openspec) proposal. This creates a traceable record of decisions and requirements. Spec deltas ensure specifications stay updated as features are built.

### Cross-agent parity is explicit

Generated OpenSpec assets for Claude, Codex, and Gemini must map equivalently to plan/apply/validate/archive intent. If one runtime drifts, docs and skill mappings should be corrected before rollout.

## Parallel Workflow Details

### Work-Packages Lifecycle

The parallel workflow decomposes features into work packages defined in `work-packages.yaml`:

1. **Plan** — `/parallel-plan-feature` produces `contracts/` and `work-packages.yaml` with package definitions, dependency DAG, scope declarations, and lock key claims.
2. **Validate** — `skills/validate-packages/scripts/validate_work_packages.py` validates against `work-packages.schema.json`: schema compliance, DAG acyclicity, lock key canonicalization, and scope non-overlap via `skills/refresh-architecture/scripts/parallel_zones.py --validate-packages`.
3. **Submit** — The orchestrator submits each package as a work queue task with `input_data` containing the package definition and context slice.
4. **Execute** — Per-package agents claim tasks, acquire locks, implement within scope boundaries, and produce structured results conforming to `work-queue-result.schema.json`.
5. **Review** — `/parallel-review-implementation` dispatches independent reviews per package. Review findings use `review-findings.schema.json` with dispositions: `fix`, `regenerate`, `accept`, `escalate`.
6. **Integrate** — A `wp-integration` merge package runs the full test suite across all completed packages.
7. **Validate** — `/parallel-validate-feature` audits evidence completeness across all package results.

### DAG Scheduling

The DAG scheduler (`skills/parallel-implement-feature/scripts/dag_scheduler.py`) manages Phase A preflight:

- **Topological ordering** via Kahn's algorithm with `sorted()` for deterministic peer ordering
- **Contract validation** — verifies all contract files referenced in packages exist
- **Context slicing** — each package agent receives only its bounded context (package definition + relevant contracts subset)
- **Task submission** — converts packages to work queue submissions with proper `depends_on` chains
- **State tracking** — packages progress through: PENDING → READY → SUBMITTED → IN_PROGRESS → COMPLETED/FAILED/CANCELLED

### Package Execution Protocol

Each package agent follows Phase B (`skills/parallel-implement-feature/scripts/package_executor.py`):

1. **Pause-lock check** (B2/B9) — checks for `feature:<id>:pause` lock before starting and before completing
2. **Deadlock-safe lock acquisition** (B3) — acquires all locks in sorted global order
3. **Implementation** — codes against contracts and mocks, not against other agents' code
4. **Scope enforcement** (B7) — post-hoc deterministic check via `fnmatch` against `write_allow`/`write_deny` globs
5. **Structured result** (B10) — produces result conforming to `work-queue-result.schema.json`

### Escalation Handling

The escalation handler (`skills/parallel-implement-feature/scripts/escalation_handler.py`) implements deterministic decisions for 8 escalation types:

| Type | Action | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| `CONTRACT_REVISION_REQUIRED` | Pause + reschedule | Contract needs update, bump revision |
| `PLAN_REVISION_REQUIRED` | Pause + replan | Work packages need restructuring |
| `RESOURCE_CONFLICT` | Retry package | Lock contention with another feature |
| `VERIFICATION_INFEASIBLE` | Fail package | Cannot meet verification requirements |
| `SCOPE_VIOLATION` | Fail package | Package modified files outside scope |
| `ENV_RESOURCE_CONFLICT` | Retry package | Environment resource contention |
| `SECURITY_ESCALATION` | Require human | Security issue needs human review |
| `FLAKY_TEST_QUARANTINE_REQUEST` | Quarantine + retry | Flaky test excluded, re-run |

### Circuit Breaking

The circuit breaker (`skills/parallel-implement-feature/scripts/circuit_breaker.py`) monitors agent health:

- **Heartbeat detection** — packages exceeding their `timeout_minutes` without heartbeat are flagged as stuck
- **Retry budget enforcement** — each package has a `retry_budget`; exhausted budgets trip the breaker
- **Cancellation propagation** — when a package is tripped, all transitive dependents are cancelled via `cancel_task_convention`

### Cross-Feature Coordination

The feature registry (`agent-coordinator/src/feature_registry.py`) and merge queue (`agent-coordinator/src/merge_queue.py`) manage program-level coordination:

- **Registration** — features register resource claims (lock keys) before implementation
- **Conflict analysis** — detects lock-key overlaps between active features
- **Feasibility assessment** — classifies parallelizability as `FULL` (no overlaps), `PARTIAL` (some shared resources), or `SEQUENTIAL` (too many conflicts)
- **Merge queue** — orders merges by priority, runs pre-merge conflict re-validation
- **Resource lifecycle** — deregisters claims on merge, freeing resources for other features

## Formal Specification

The skills workflow is formally specified with requirements covering iterative refinement, structured analysis, commit conventions, documentation updates, parallel execution patterns, worktree isolation, feature validation (with inline security scanning), bug-scrub signal collection, and fix-scrub remediation tiers.

See [`openspec/specs/skill-workflow/spec.md`](../openspec/specs/skill-workflow/spec.md) for the complete specification.

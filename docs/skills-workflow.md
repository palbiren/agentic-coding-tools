# Skills Workflow

A structured feature development workflow for AI-assisted coding. Skills are reusable Claude Code slash commands that guide features from proposal through implementation to completion, with human approval gates at each stage.

## Overview

The workflow breaks feature development into discrete stages, each handled by a dedicated skill. Every stage ends at a natural approval gate where a human reviews and approves before the next stage begins. This design supports asynchronous workflows where an AI agent can do focused work, then hand off for review.

## Unified Skills with Tiered Execution

Each workflow skill auto-selects its execution tier at startup based on coordinator availability and feature complexity:

| Tier | Coordinator | Artifacts | Execution |
|------|------------|-----------|-----------|
| **Coordinated** | Available | Contracts + work-packages + resource claims | Multi-agent DAG via coordinator |
| **Local parallel** | Unavailable | Contracts + work-packages (no claims) | DAG via built-in Agent parallelism |
| **Sequential** | Unavailable | Tasks.md only | Single-agent sequential |

```
# Single-change workflow
/explore-feature [focus-area]                          Candidate feature shortlist
/plan-feature <description>                            Proposal approval gate
  /iterate-on-plan <change-id> (optional)              Refines plan before approval
  /parallel-review-plan <change-id> (optional)         Independent plan review (vendor-diverse)
/implement-feature <change-id>                         PR review gate (auto-validates: spec, evidence)
  /iterate-on-implementation <change-id>               Refinement complete
  /parallel-review-implementation <change-id>          Per-package review (vendor-diverse)
/cleanup-feature <change-id>                           Done (auto-validates: deploy, smoke, security, e2e)

# Multi-change roadmap orchestration (wraps the single-change workflow)
/plan-roadmap <proposal-path>                          Decompose proposal → prioritized roadmap
/autopilot-roadmap <workspace-path>                    Execute roadmap items with learning feedback
```

Validation is built into the workflow: `/implement-feature` runs environment-safe phases (spec compliance, evidence completeness), `/cleanup-feature` and `/merge-pull-requests` run Docker-dependent phases (deploy, smoke, security, E2E) before merge. All delegate to `/validate-feature --phase <phases>`. The skill can also be invoked directly for a full manual pass.

Old `linear-*` and `parallel-*` prefixed names are accepted as trigger aliases. Using a `parallel-*` trigger forces at least the local-parallel tier.

See [Parallel Agentic Development](parallel-agentic-development.md) for the full implementation reference.

## Prerequisites

- OpenSpec CLI installed (v1.0+): `npm install -g @fission-ai/openspec`
- Repository initialized for OpenSpec (once per repo): `openspec init`
- Validate environment before running workflow skills:
  - `openspec list`
  - `openspec list --specs`

```
/plan-feature <description>                            Proposal approval gate
  /iterate-on-plan <change-id> (optional)              Refines plan before approval
/implement-feature <change-id>                         PR review gate
  /iterate-on-implementation <change-id>               Refinement complete
  /refresh-architecture [mode] (optional)              Regenerate/validate architecture artifacts
  /validate-feature <change-id> (optional)             Live deployment verification (includes security scanning)
/cleanup-feature <change-id>                           Done
```

Optional discovery stage before planning:

```
/explore-feature [focus-area]                          Candidate feature shortlist
/refresh-architecture (optional)                       Fresh architecture context for planning
```

Architecture refresh callout:
- Default path: run `/refresh-architecture` before `/plan-feature` if `docs/architecture-analysis/` is stale, missing, or after substantial structural changes.
- Advanced modes: run `/refresh-architecture --validate` after `/implement-feature` or `/iterate-on-implementation`, and `/refresh-architecture --diff <base-sha>` before `/validate-feature`.

## Step Dependencies

| Step | Depends On | Unblocks |
|---|---|---|

## Artifact Flow By Step

| Step | Consumes | Produces/Updates |

| `/cleanup-feature` | PR state + `tasks.md` completion | Archived change (`openspec/changes/archive/...`), updated `openspec/specs/`, optional `openspec/changes/<id>/deferred-tasks.md` prior to archive |

## OpenSpec 1.0 Integration

High-level workflow skills stay stable, but their internals follow this precedence:

1. Agent-native OpenSpec assets for the active runtime
2. Direct `openspec` CLI fallback

Runtime asset locations:
- Claude: `.claude/commands/opsx/*.md`, `.claude/skills/openspec-*/SKILL.md`
- Codex: `.codex/skills/openspec-*/SKILL.md`
- Gemini: `.gemini/commands/opsx/*.toml`, `.gemini/skills/openspec-*/SKILL.md`

Cross-agent mapping parity:

| Intent | Claude | Codex | Gemini |
|---|---|---|---|
| Plan (new/ff) | `new`, `ff` | `openspec-new-change`, `openspec-ff-change` | `new`, `ff` |
| Continue/findings | `continue` | `openspec-continue-change` | `continue` |
| Apply | `apply` | `openspec-apply-change` | `apply` |
| Verify | `verify` | `openspec-verify-change` | `verify` |
| Archive | `archive` | `openspec-archive-change` | `archive` |
| Sync | `sync` | `openspec-sync-specs` (alias of sync intent) | `sync` |

CLI fallback commands:
- `openspec new change`
- `openspec status --change <id>`
- `openspec instructions <artifact|apply> --change <id>`
- `openspec archive <id> --yes`

## Coordinator Integration Model

### Canonical Skill Distribution

`skills/` is the source of truth for workflow skill content.

Runtime skill trees are synced mirrors:

- `.claude/skills/`
- `.codex/skills/`
- `.gemini/skills/`

Use the existing rsync workflow (no alternate distribution path):

```bash
skills/install.sh --mode rsync --agents claude,codex,gemini --deps none --python-tools none
```

After sync, any drift between canonical and runtime mirrors is a parity defect.

### Transport and Capability Flags

Integrated skills use a shared preamble (`docs/coordination-detection-template.md`) and set:

- `COORDINATOR_AVAILABLE`
- `COORDINATION_TRANSPORT` (`mcp|http|none`)
- `CAN_LOCK`
- `CAN_QUEUE_WORK`
- `CAN_HANDOFF`
- `CAN_MEMORY`
- `CAN_GUARDRAILS`

Transport model:

- CLI runtimes: MCP detection by tool availability
- Web/Cloud runtimes: HTTP detection via `skills/coordination-bridge/scripts/coordination_bridge.py`
- No coordinator: fallback to standalone skill behavior

Hook execution is capability-gated: a hook runs only when its `CAN_*` flag is true.

### Explicit Runtime Parity Tests (3 Providers x 2 Transports)

Run these checks before marking coordinator skill integration ready.

#### Preflight: canonical sync and mirror consistency

```bash
skills/install.sh --mode rsync --agents claude,codex,gemini --deps none --python-tools none
```

Verify representative integrated skills match canonical content:

```bash
for skill in explore-feature plan-feature implement-feature iterate-on-plan iterate-on-implementation validate-feature cleanup-feature security-review setup-coordinator; do
  diff -u "skills/$skill/SKILL.md" ".claude/skills/$skill/SKILL.md"
  diff -u "skills/$skill/SKILL.md" ".codex/skills/$skill/SKILL.md"
  diff -u "skills/$skill/SKILL.md" ".gemini/skills/$skill/SKILL.md"
done
```

#### MCP matrix (local CLI)

Run once per runtime:

1. Claude Codex CLI + MCP
2. Codex CLI + MCP
3. Gemini CLI + MCP

Assertions per runtime:

- Detection resolves `COORDINATION_TRANSPORT=mcp`
- `CAN_*` flags reflect exposed MCP tools
- `/implement-feature` only runs lock/queue/guardrail hooks when corresponding flags are true
- `/plan-feature` or `/iterate-on-plan` only runs handoff hooks when `CAN_HANDOFF=true`
- `/validate-feature` and `/iterate-on-*` only runs memory hooks when `CAN_MEMORY=true`

#### HTTP matrix (Web/Cloud)

Run once per runtime:

1. Claude Web + HTTP API
2. Codex Cloud/Web + HTTP API
3. Gemini Web/Cloud + HTTP API

Baseline HTTP assertion command:

```bash
python3 skills/coordination-bridge/scripts/coordination_bridge.py detect --http-url "$COORDINATION_API_URL" --api-key "$COORDINATION_API_KEY"
```

Assertions per runtime:

- Detection resolves `COORDINATION_TRANSPORT=http`
- Bridge capability flags match reachable HTTP endpoints (including partial capability cases)
- Integrated skill hooks honor capability gating
- Guardrail violations are informational in phase 1 and do not hard-block execution

#### Degraded fallback matrix (both transports)

For each of the six runtime dimensions above, simulate coordinator unavailability:

- MCP unavailable (disable coordinator MCP server/tools)
- HTTP unavailable (bad URL, network block, or invalid API key)

Expected behavior:

- Detection resolves `COORDINATION_TRANSPORT=none` and/or `COORDINATOR_AVAILABLE=false` as appropriate
- Skills continue standalone flow without coordinator-induced hard failure
- HTTP bridge helpers return `status="skipped"` for unavailable operations
- Lock cleanup/release paths remain best-effort and non-fatal

## Core Skills

### `/explore-feature`

Identifies what to build next using architecture diagnostics, active OpenSpec state, and codebase risk/opportunity signals (for example refactoring candidates, usability improvements, performance/cost opportunities).

**Method**:
- Scores opportunities with a weighted model (`impact`, `strategic-fit`, `effort`, `risk`) for reproducible ranking
- Buckets results into `quick-win` and `big-bet`
- Captures explicit `blocked-by` dependencies per candidate
- Uses recommendation history to avoid repeatedly surfacing unchanged deferred work

**Produces**:
- Ranked feature shortlist and one concrete recommendation to start with `/plan-feature`
- `docs/feature-discovery/opportunities.json` (machine-readable current ranking)
- `docs/feature-discovery/history.json` (recommendation history for future prioritization)

**Gate**: None (discovery/support step).

### `/plan-feature`

Creates an [OpenSpec](https://github.com/fission-ai/openspec) proposal for a new feature. The skill gathers context from existing specs and code using parallel exploration agents, then scaffolds a complete proposal with requirements, tasks, and spec deltas using runtime-native OpenSpec assets first and CLI fallback second.

**Produces**: `openspec/changes/<change-id>/` containing `proposal.md`, `tasks.md`, `design.md`, and spec deltas in `specs/`

**Gate**: Proposal approval — the human reviews the proposal before implementation begins.

### `/iterate-on-plan`

Refines an OpenSpec proposal through structured iteration. Each iteration reviews the proposal documents, identifies quality issues across seven dimensions (completeness, clarity, feasibility, scope, consistency, testability, parallelizability), implements fixes, and commits. Repeats until only low-criticality findings remain or max iterations (default: 3) are reached.

**Produces**: Iteration commits improving proposal documents, a parallelizability assessment, and a proposal readiness checklist.

**Gate**: Same as `/plan-feature` — the refined proposal still needs human approval.

### `/implement-feature`

Implements an approved proposal using a test-driven approach with full traceability from specs through contracts to tests.

The workflow enforces TDD structurally through task ordering and the `change-context.md` artifact:

1. **Plan phase** (`/plan-feature`): Test tasks are ordered *before* implementation tasks in `tasks.md`, with explicit references to spec scenarios, contract files, and design decisions they validate.
2. **Phase 1 — TDD RED** (`change-context.md`): Generates a Requirement Traceability Matrix mapping each spec requirement to its contract reference, design decision, and planned tests. Writes failing tests that assert against contracted interfaces and design choices.
3. **Phase 2 — TDD GREEN**: Implements code to make tests pass. Works through tasks sequentially or in parallel (for independent tasks with no file overlap).
4. **Phase 3 — Validation**: `/validate-feature` populates evidence in `change-context.md`.

Runs quality checks (pytest, mypy, ruff, openspec validate) and creates a PR. Uses runtime-native apply guidance first and `openspec instructions apply` as fallback.

**Produces**: Feature branch `openspec/<change-id>`, `change-context.md` (traceability matrix with contract refs, design decisions, code mapping, and evidence), passing tests, and a PR ready for review.

**Gate**: PR review — the human reviews the implementation before merge.

### `/iterate-on-implementation`

Refines a feature implementation through structured iteration. Each iteration reviews the code against the proposal, identifies improvements (bugs, edge cases, workflow issues, performance, UX), implements fixes, and commits. Supports parallel fixes for findings targeting different files. Also updates OpenSpec documents if spec drift is detected.

**Produces**: Iteration commits on the feature branch with structured findings summaries.

**Gate**: Same as `/implement-feature` — the refined PR still needs human review.

### `/validate-feature`

Deploys the feature locally with DEBUG logging and runs seven validation phases:

1. **Deploy** — Starts services via docker-compose
2. **Smoke** — Verifies health endpoints, auth enforcement, CORS, error sanitization, and security headers
3. **Security** — Runs OWASP Dependency-Check and ZAP against the live deployment (non-critical; degrades gracefully if prerequisites missing)
4. **E2E** — Runs Playwright end-to-end tests (if available)
5. **Architecture** — Validates architecture flows against changed files
6. **Spec Compliance** — Populates evidence in `change-context.md` by verifying each requirement against the live system (Phase 3 of the traceability matrix)
7. **Log Analysis** — Scans logs for warnings, errors, stack traces, and deprecation notices

Also checks CI/CD status via GitHub CLI. Produces a structured validation report (which references `change-context.md` for spec compliance details), security scanner outputs, and architecture-impact artifact, persists them to the change directory, and posts report results to the PR.

**Produces**: `openspec/changes/<change-id>/validation-report.md`, `openspec/changes/<change-id>/change-context.md` (evidence populated), `openspec/changes/<change-id>/architecture-impact.md`, and a PR comment.

**Gate**: Validation results — the human decides whether to proceed to cleanup or address findings.

### `/security-review`

Runs a reusable cross-project security gate with project profile detection and pluggable scanners. Supports OWASP Dependency-Check and ZAP container adapters (Podman/Desktop or Docker-compatible runtime), normalizes findings, and computes a deterministic `PASS`/`FAIL`/`INCONCLUSIVE` decision from a configurable threshold.

Security scanning is also available inline as a phase within `/validate-feature`, which is the recommended path for feature development workflows (ZAP benefits from the live deployment). Use `/security-review` standalone for ad-hoc scans, CI pipelines, or when you need security scanning without full validation.

**Produces**: canonical report outputs under `docs/security-review/` and optionally `openspec/changes/<change-id>/security-review-report.md`.

**Gate**: Security gate result — the human decides whether to remediate findings.

### `/cleanup-feature`

Merges the approved PR, migrates any open tasks (to Beads issues or a follow-up OpenSpec proposal), archives the proposal via runtime-native archive guidance or CLI fallback, and cleans up branches.

**Produces**: Merged PR, archived proposal in `openspec/changes/archive/<change-id>/`, updated specs in `openspec/specs/`.

**Gate**: None — this is the final mechanical step.

## Supporting Skills

### `/refresh-architecture`

Regenerates, validates, or inspects `docs/architecture-analysis/` artifacts that describe code structure, cross-layer flows, and safe parallel modification zones.

**Modes**:
- Full refresh: `make architecture`
- Validate only: `make architecture-validate`
- Views only: `make architecture-views`
- Report only: `make architecture-report`
- Diff to baseline: `make architecture-diff BASE_SHA=<sha>`
- Feature slice: `make architecture-feature FEATURE="<files>"`

**Produces**: Updated architecture artifacts in `docs/architecture-analysis/` for planning context, implementation safety checks, and validation/reporting.

**Gate**: None (support/verification step).

### `/merge-pull-requests`

Triages, reviews, and merges open PRs from multiple sources: OpenSpec feature PRs, Jules automation PRs, Codex PRs, Dependabot/Renovate PRs, and manual PRs. Includes staleness detection and review comment analysis.

### `/prioritize-proposals`

Analyzes all active OpenSpec proposals against recent commit history. Produces a prioritized "what to do next" report optimized for minimal file conflicts and parallel agent work. Detects proposals that may already be addressed by recent commits or need refinement due to code drift.

### `/update-specs`

Updates OpenSpec spec files to reflect what was actually built. Used after implementation work where debugging, testing, code review, or interactive refinements revealed differences between the original spec and the final implementation.

### `/openspec-beads-worktree`

Coordinates OpenSpec proposals with coordinator issue tracking and isolated git worktree execution. Implements systematic spec-driven development with parallel agent coordination. (Formerly used Beads — now uses coordinator's built-in issue tracker.)

### `/bug-scrub`

Performs a comprehensive project health check by collecting signals from CI tools (pytest, ruff, mypy, openspec validate), existing reports (architecture diagnostics, security review), deferred OpenSpec issues, and code markers (TODO/FIXME/HACK/XXX). Aggregates all findings into a unified schema and produces a prioritized report.

**Method**:
- Runs signal collectors in parallel, each producing normalized `Finding` objects
- Aggregates, sorts by severity/age, and generates actionable recommendations
- Reports committed to `docs/bug-scrub/` for cross-agent access

**Produces**: `docs/bug-scrub/bug-scrub-report.md` (human-readable) and `docs/bug-scrub/bug-scrub-report.json` (machine-readable for `/fix-scrub`).

**Gate**: None (diagnostic/support step).

### `/fix-scrub`

Consumes the bug-scrub report and applies remediation. Classifies findings into three fixability tiers: auto (tool-native fixes like `ruff --fix`), agent (Task()-dispatched code fixes with file scope isolation), and manual (reported but not fixed). Runs quality verification after fixes and tracks OpenSpec task completions.

**Method**:
- Classifies findings → plans by file scope → applies auto-fixes → dispatches agent-fixes → verifies quality → commits
- Updates `tasks.md` checkboxes when deferred findings are resolved

**Produces**: `docs/bug-scrub/fix-scrub-report.md` with tier breakdown, files changed, tasks completed, and manual action items.

**Gate**: None — but prompts user before committing if regressions are detected.

**Workflow pair**: Run `/bug-scrub` first (diagnosis), then `/fix-scrub` (remediation).

## Roadmap Orchestration

The core workflow above handles **one OpenSpec change at a time**. For larger initiatives — long markdown proposals from Claude Chat, Perplexity, or ChatGPT Pro that describe multiple capabilities — the roadmap layer decomposes and orchestrates multiple changes.

```
/plan-roadmap <proposal-path>          Decompose proposal → prioritized roadmap
/autopilot-roadmap <workspace-path>    Execute roadmap items with learning feedback
```

### How it relates to the single-change workflow

The roadmap skills **wrap** the existing workflow rather than replacing it:

```
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  /plan-roadmap                                                 │
│  1. Parse proposal → extract capabilities, constraints, phases │
│  2. Build candidate items with size validation (merge/split)   │
│  3. Construct dependency DAG                                   │
│  4. User approves candidates                                   │
│  5. Scaffold OpenSpec changes (one per approved item)           │
│     └── Each scaffolded change has proposal.md, tasks.md,      │

│  For each ready item (dependency-aware, priority order):       │
│    ├── /plan-feature (if needed)                               │
│    ├── /implement-feature                                      │

│    └── Replan: adjust priorities of pending items              │
│  On vendor limit:                                              │
│    └── Policy engine: wait / switch / fail-closed              │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Key concepts

**Progressive disclosure learning log**: Each completed item writes a learning entry to `learnings/<item-id>.md`. Before executing the next item, the orchestrator loads only direct-dependency entries plus the 3 most recent — bounding context to O(k) not O(n). At 50+ entries, a compaction pass archives older entries.

**Vendor scheduling policy**: When a vendor hits rate/budget limits, the policy engine (`roadmap.yaml` → `policy` section) decides:
- `wait_if_budget_exceeded` (default): Pause until reset window
- `switch_if_time_saved`: Route to alternate vendor if cost ceiling allows
- Cascading failover: Recursive evaluation across vendors up to `max_switch_attempts_per_item`
- Fail closed: Block the item when no vendor can proceed

**Checkpoint resume**: Execution state persists in `checkpoint.json`. If interrupted, `/autopilot-roadmap` resumes from the last successful phase without duplicating work.

**Item failure handling**: Failed items are marked in the roadmap with a structured reason. Dependents transition to `blocked` or `replan_required`. The orchestrator continues with independent items rather than halting.

### Architecture

Three skill directories support roadmap orchestration:

| Skill | Role | Location |
|-------|------|----------|
| `roadmap-runtime` | Shared library (models, checkpoint, learning, sanitizer, context) | `skills/roadmap-runtime/` |
| `plan-roadmap` | Proposal decomposition and change scaffolding | `skills/plan-roadmap/` |
| `autopilot-roadmap` | Execution loop, policy engine, adaptive replanning | `skills/autopilot-roadmap/` |

Artifact schemas live at `openspec/schemas/roadmap.schema.json`, `checkpoint.schema.json`, and `learning-log.schema.json`.

### When to use roadmap vs single-change

| Scenario | Use |
|----------|-----|
| One capability, clear scope | `/plan-feature` → `/implement-feature` |
| Full lifecycle automation of one change | `/autopilot` |
| Long proposal with 3+ distinct capabilities | `/plan-roadmap` → `/autopilot-roadmap` |
| Multi-phase initiative with dependencies between capabilities | `/plan-roadmap` → `/autopilot-roadmap` |

## Design Principles

### Skills map to approval gates

Each skill ends at a natural handoff point where human approval is needed. `/plan-feature` stops at proposal approval, `/implement-feature` stops at PR review. This creates clean boundaries between AI work and human oversight.

### Creative and mechanical work are separated

Planning and implementation are creative work requiring judgment. Cleanup and archival are mechanical. Separating them into different skills allows the mechanical steps to be delegated or automated with higher confidence.

### Iteration happens at both creative stages

Both proposals and implementations benefit from structured refinement. `/iterate-on-plan` catches quality issues before implementation begins, while `/iterate-on-implementation` catches bugs and edge cases before PR review. Each uses domain-specific finding types and quality checks.

### Parallel execution is first-class

Task decomposition in proposals explicitly identifies dependencies and maximizes independent work units. The `Task()` tool with `run_in_background=true` enables concurrent agents without worktrees. File scope isolation via prompts prevents merge conflicts — each agent's prompt lists exactly which files it may modify.

### All planning flows through OpenSpec

Every non-trivial feature starts with an [OpenSpec](https://github.com/fission-ai/openspec) proposal. This creates a traceable record of decisions and requirements. Spec deltas ensure specifications stay updated as features are built.

### Merge strategy is origin-aware

PRs use a **hybrid merge strategy** that varies by origin. Agent-authored PRs (`openspec`, `codex`) use **rebase-merge** to preserve granular commit history — this makes `git blame` point to specific sub-changes and `git bisect` work at commit granularity rather than PR granularity. Dependency updates (`dependabot`, `renovate`) and automation PRs use **squash-merge** to keep main clean. The operator can override per-PR.

This hybrid approach is motivated by the observation that squash-merge's primary benefit (reducing cognitive clutter for humans scanning `git log`) is irrelevant for AI assistants, while its costs (lost history, broken `git branch --merged` detection causing stale branch accumulation) are amplified in agentic workflows. To support rebase-merge, `/implement-feature` requires clean conventional commits — one logical commit per task, not WIP fragments.

### Cross-agent parity is explicit

Generated OpenSpec assets for Claude, Codex, and Gemini must map equivalently to plan/apply/validate/archive intent. If one runtime drifts, docs and skill mappings should be corrected before rollout.

## Parallel Workflow Details

For the complete parallel workflow implementation reference — including work-package lifecycle, DAG scheduling, execution protocol, escalation handling, circuit breaking, and cross-feature coordination — see [`parallel-agentic-development.md`](parallel-agentic-development.md).

## Formal Specification

The skills workflow is formally specified with requirements covering iterative refinement, structured analysis, commit conventions, documentation updates, parallel execution patterns, worktree isolation, feature validation (with inline security scanning), bug-scrub signal collection, and fix-scrub remediation tiers.

See [`openspec/specs/skill-workflow/spec.md`](../openspec/specs/skill-workflow/spec.md) for the complete specification.

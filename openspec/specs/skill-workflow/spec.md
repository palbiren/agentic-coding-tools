# skill-workflow Specification

## Purpose
TBD - created by archiving change add-iterate-on-implementation-skill. Update Purpose after archive.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Iterative Refinement Skill
The system SHALL provide an `iterate-on-implementation` skill that performs structured iterative refinement of a feature implementation after `/implement-feature` completes and before `/cleanup-feature` runs.

The skill SHALL accept the following arguments:
- Change-id (required; or detected from current branch name `openspec/<change-id>`)
- Max iterations (optional; default: 5)
- Criticality threshold (optional; default: "medium"; values: "critical", "high", "medium", "low")

#### Scenario: Basic iterative refinement
- **WHEN** the user invokes `/iterate-on-implementation <change-id>`
- **THEN** the skill SHALL review the proposal, design, tasks, and current implementation code
- **AND** produce a structured improvement analysis for each iteration
- **AND** implement all findings at or above the criticality threshold
- **AND** commit the iteration's changes as a separate commit
- **AND** update documentation (CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, or docs/) with new lessons learned
- **AND** repeat until max iterations reached or only findings below threshold remain

#### Scenario: Early termination when only low-criticality findings remain
- **WHEN** an iteration's analysis produces only findings below the criticality threshold
- **THEN** the skill SHALL stop iterating and present a summary of all completed iterations
- **AND** report the remaining low-criticality findings for optional manual review

#### Scenario: Max iterations reached
- **WHEN** the configured max iterations have been completed
- **THEN** the skill SHALL stop iterating and present a summary
- **AND** report any remaining findings that were not addressed

#### Scenario: Out-of-scope findings
- **WHEN** an iteration identifies an issue that requires design changes beyond the current proposal scope
- **THEN** the skill SHALL flag the finding as "out of scope"
- **AND** recommend creating a new OpenSpec proposal for it
- **AND** NOT attempt to implement the out-of-scope change

#### Scenario: Parallel quality check execution
- **WHEN** the skill runs quality checks (pytest, mypy, ruff, openspec validate)
- **THEN** the skill SHALL execute all quality checks concurrently using Task(Bash) with run_in_background=true
- **AND** collect all results before reporting
- **AND** report all failures together rather than fail-fast on first error

#### Scenario: Quality check partial failure
- **WHEN** one or more quality checks fail while others succeed
- **THEN** the skill SHALL report all check results (both passing and failing)
- **AND** indicate which specific checks failed
- **AND** continue with iteration if fixes are possible

### Requirement: Structured Improvement Analysis
Each iteration SHALL produce a structured analysis where every finding contains:
- **Type**: One of bug, edge-case, workflow, performance, UX
- **Criticality**: One of critical, high, medium, low
- **Description**: What the issue is and why it matters
- **Proposed fix**: How to address the finding

#### Scenario: Analysis covers all improvement categories
- **WHEN** the skill reviews the current implementation
- **THEN** it SHALL evaluate for bugs, unhandled edge cases, workflow improvements, performance issues, and UX issues (where applicable)
- **AND** classify each finding by type and criticality

#### Scenario: Analysis is reproducible and auditable
- **WHEN** an iteration completes
- **THEN** the findings and actions taken SHALL be recorded in the commit message for that iteration

### Requirement: Iteration Commit Convention
Each iteration SHALL produce exactly one commit on the current feature branch with a message following this format:
```
refine(<scope>): iteration <N> - <summary>

Iterate-on-implementation: <change-id>, iteration <N>/<max>

Findings addressed:
- [<criticality>] <type>: <description>

Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>
```

#### Scenario: Commit per iteration
- **WHEN** an iteration implements improvements
- **THEN** all changes for that iteration SHALL be staged and committed as a single commit
- **AND** the commit message SHALL list the findings addressed with their criticality and type

### Requirement: Documentation Update Per Iteration
Each iteration SHALL review whether genuinely new patterns, lessons, or gotchas were discovered and, if so, update the relevant documentation files.

Documentation updates SHALL follow the existing convention:
- Update CLAUDE.md or AGENTS.md directly if they are under 300 lines each
- If either file exceeds 300 lines, refactor into focused documents in docs/ and reference them

#### Scenario: New lesson discovered during iteration
- **WHEN** an iteration reveals a pattern or gotcha not already documented
- **THEN** the skill SHALL add the lesson to CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, or the appropriate docs/ file
- **AND** include the documentation change in the iteration's commit

#### Scenario: No new lessons in an iteration
- **WHEN** an iteration's findings are variations of already-documented patterns
- **THEN** the skill SHALL NOT add redundant documentation

### Requirement: OpenSpec Document Update Per Iteration
Each iteration SHALL review whether the current OpenSpec documents (proposal.md, design.md, spec deltas) accurately reflect the refined implementation. When findings reveal spec drift, incorrect assumptions, or missing requirements, the relevant OpenSpec documents SHALL be updated.

#### Scenario: OpenSpec document update on spec drift
- **WHEN** an iteration reveals that the proposal, design, or spec deltas contain assumptions or requirements that don't match the refined implementation
- **THEN** the skill SHALL update the relevant OpenSpec documents to reflect the actual state
- **AND** include those changes in the iteration's commit

#### Scenario: OpenSpec documents still accurate
- **WHEN** an iteration's changes are consistent with the existing OpenSpec documents
- **THEN** the skill SHALL NOT make unnecessary changes to OpenSpec documents

### Requirement: Skill Workflow Position

The `iterate-on-implementation` skill SHALL fit into the feature development workflow as an optional step between `/implement-feature` and `/cleanup-feature`. The `validate-feature` skill SHALL fit as an optional step between `/iterate-on-implementation` and `/cleanup-feature`:

```
/plan-feature → /implement-feature → /iterate-on-implementation (optional) → /validate-feature (optional) → /cleanup-feature
```

#### Scenario: Workflow integration
- **WHEN** the user completes `/implement-feature` and has a PR ready for review
- **THEN** they MAY invoke `/iterate-on-implementation` to refine the implementation before requesting review
- **AND** they MAY invoke `/validate-feature` to verify the deployed feature works correctly
- **AND** the skills SHALL operate on the existing feature branch without creating new branches

#### Scenario: Validate after iterate
- **WHEN** the user completes `/iterate-on-implementation`
- **THEN** they MAY invoke `/validate-feature` to verify the refined implementation against live deployment
- **AND** if validation fails, they MAY return to `/iterate-on-implementation` to address findings

#### Scenario: Validate without iterate
- **WHEN** the user completes `/implement-feature` without running `/iterate-on-implementation`
- **THEN** they MAY invoke `/validate-feature` directly
- **AND** the validation skill SHALL work regardless of whether iterate was run

### Requirement: Parallel Task Implementation Pattern
The `implement-feature` and `iterate-on-implementation` skills SHALL support parallel Task() subagents for implementing independent tasks or fixes concurrently.

#### Scenario: Spawn parallel implementation agents
- **WHEN** the skill identifies independent tasks (no shared files) that can be parallelized
- **THEN** it MAY spawn Task(general-purpose) agents with run_in_background=true
- **AND** scope each agent's prompt to specific files/modules
- **AND** NOT create git worktrees for agent isolation

#### Scenario: Agent file scope enforcement
- **WHEN** multiple agents are spawned for parallel implementation
- **THEN** each agent's prompt SHALL explicitly list which files/modules are in scope
- **AND** tasks with overlapping file scope SHALL be executed sequentially, not in parallel

#### Scenario: Result collection and integration
- **WHEN** all parallel agents complete their tasks
- **THEN** the orchestrator SHALL collect results using TaskOutput
- **AND** verify each agent's work before committing
- **AND** create a single commit integrating all agent work (or separate commits if appropriate)

#### Scenario: Agent failure recovery
- **WHEN** a background agent fails during execution
- **THEN** the orchestrator SHALL report the failure with context
- **AND** MAY attempt recovery using the Task resume parameter
- **AND** SHALL NOT commit partial work from failed agents without user confirmation

### Requirement: Parallel Context Exploration Pattern
Skills that gather context (plan-feature, iterate-on-plan) SHALL support parallel Task(Explore) agents for faster context collection when multiple independent sources need analysis.

#### Scenario: Parallel exploration execution
- **WHEN** a skill needs to gather context from multiple sources (specs, code, in-progress changes)
- **THEN** it MAY spawn multiple Task(Explore) agents concurrently
- **AND** synthesize the results after all agents complete

#### Scenario: Exploration is read-only
- **WHEN** Task(Explore) agents are used for context gathering
- **THEN** they SHALL NOT modify any files
- **AND** they SHALL return analysis results to the orchestrator for synthesis

### Requirement: Worktree Isolation Pattern

The `implement-feature`, `iterate-on-implementation`, `cleanup-feature`, and `fix-scrub` skills SHALL support per-feature git worktree isolation to enable concurrent CLI sessions working on different features.

Worktrees SHALL be created at `.git-worktrees/<change-id>/` inside the project root (gitignored), instead of `../<repo-name>.worktrees/<change-id>/`.

Skills that create, remove, or detect worktrees SHALL use `scripts/worktree.py` instead of inline bash commands. The script SHALL use only Python standard library modules and SHALL be invokable via `python3 scripts/worktree.py <subcommand>`, matching the pre-approved `Bash(python3:*)` permission pattern.

#### Scenario: Worktree creation on implement-feature
- **WHEN** the user invokes `/implement-feature <change-id>`
- **THEN** the skill SHALL invoke `python3 scripts/worktree.py setup <change-id>`
- **AND** the worktree SHALL be created at `<project-root>/.git-worktrees/<change-id>/`
- **AND** create the feature branch `openspec/<change-id>` if it doesn't exist
- **AND** change the working directory to the worktree
- **AND** continue implementation in the worktree

#### Scenario: Skip worktree creation when already in worktree
- **WHEN** the user invokes `/implement-feature <change-id>`
- **AND** the current working directory is already the worktree for that change-id
- **THEN** the skill SHALL skip worktree creation
- **AND** continue with implementation

#### Scenario: Worktree detection in iterate-on-implementation
- **WHEN** the user invokes `/iterate-on-implementation <change-id>`
- **AND** the current working directory is a git worktree
- **THEN** the skill SHALL invoke `python3 scripts/worktree.py detect`
- **AND** resolve OpenSpec files from the main repository
- **AND** operate normally on implementation files in the worktree

#### Scenario: Worktree cleanup on cleanup-feature
- **WHEN** the user invokes `/cleanup-feature <change-id>`
- **AND** a worktree exists for that change-id
- **THEN** the skill SHALL invoke `python3 scripts/worktree.py teardown <change-id>`
- **AND** the teardown SHALL check both `.git-worktrees/` and legacy `../<repo>.worktrees/` locations
- **AND** NOT remove the worktree if cleanup is aborted

### Requirement: OpenSpec File Access in Worktrees

Skills running in worktrees SHALL access OpenSpec files from the main repository, not from the worktree.

#### Scenario: OpenSpec path resolution in worktree
- **WHEN** a skill needs to read OpenSpec files (proposal.md, tasks.md, design.md, specs/)
- **AND** the skill is running in a worktree
- **THEN** it SHALL resolve the path relative to the main repository using git-common-dir
- **AND** NOT expect OpenSpec files to exist in the worktree

### Requirement: Feature Validation Skill

The system SHALL provide a `validate-feature` skill that deploys the feature locally, runs behavioral tests against the live system, **runs security scans against the live deployment**, checks CI/CD status, and verifies OpenSpec spec compliance. The skill operates between `/iterate-on-implementation` and `/cleanup-feature` in the workflow.

The skill SHALL accept the following arguments:
- Change-id (required; or detected from current branch name `openspec/<change-id>`)

Valid phase names SHALL include: `deploy`, `smoke`, `security`, `e2e`, `architecture`, `spec`, `logs`, `ci`

#### Scenario: Full validation run includes security scanning
- **WHEN** the user invokes `/validate-feature <change-id>`
- **THEN** the skill SHALL execute validation in seven sequential phases: Deploy, Smoke, Security, E2E, Architecture, Spec Compliance, Log Analysis
- **AND** the Security phase SHALL run after Smoke confirms the API is healthy
- **AND** the Security phase SHALL run before E2E
- **AND** produce a structured validation report with pass/fail/skip/degraded per phase
- **AND** include security scan results in the validation report

#### Scenario: Security phase invokes security-review orchestrator
- **WHEN** the Security phase begins and services are confirmed healthy by Smoke
- **THEN** the skill SHALL invoke `security-review/scripts/main.py` with:
  - `--repo` pointing to the repository root
  - `--zap-target` pointing to the live API URL (e.g., `http://localhost:${AGENT_COORDINATOR_REST_PORT}`)
  - `--change` set to the current change-id
  - `--out-dir` set to `docs/security-review`
  - `--allow-degraded-pass` enabled
- **AND** capture the exit code and report output
- **AND** report the gate decision (PASS/FAIL/INCONCLUSIVE) in the phase result

#### Scenario: Security phase is non-critical
- **WHEN** the Security phase fails (exit code 10 = FAIL or exit code 11 = INCONCLUSIVE)
- **THEN** the skill SHALL continue with remaining phases (E2E, Architecture, Spec Compliance, Log Analysis)
- **AND** include the security findings in the final validation report
- **AND** NOT stop validation

#### Scenario: Security phase skipped via flag

- **THEN** the skill SHALL skip the Security phase entirely
- **AND** report the phase as "skipped" in the validation report
- **AND** NOT treat the skip as a failure

#### Scenario: Security phase degrades gracefully when prerequisites missing

- **THEN** the Security phase SHALL report degraded coverage (INCONCLUSIVE with `--allow-degraded-pass`)
- **AND** list which scanners were unavailable and why
- **AND** NOT block validation

#### Scenario: Security phase with selective phases
- **WHEN** the user invokes `/validate-feature <change-id> --phase security`
- **THEN** the skill SHALL run only the Security phase (assuming services are already running)
- **AND** NOT run Deploy, Smoke, E2E, or other phases

- **AND** include a timestamp and the git commit SHA at the top of the report

#### Scenario: Report posted as PR comment
- **WHEN** validation completes and a PR exists for the `openspec/<change-id>` branch
- **THEN** the skill SHALL post the validation report as a comment on the PR via `gh pr comment`
- **AND** prefix the comment with a header identifying it as an automated validation report

#### Scenario: No PR exists
- **WHEN** validation completes and no PR exists for the feature branch
- **THEN** the skill SHALL skip the PR comment step with an informational message
- **AND** still persist the report to the file

### Requirement: Validation Report Format

The validation skill SHALL produce a structured validation report at the end of each run that summarizes all phase results.

#### Scenario: All phases pass
- **WHEN** all validation phases pass
- **THEN** the report SHALL show a summary like:
  ```
  Validation Report: <change-id>
  ✓ Deploy: Services started (3 containers, DEBUG logging enabled)
  ✓ Smoke: All health checks passed (API, MCP, database)
  ✓ E2E: 5/5 Playwright tests passed
  ✓ Spec Compliance: 8/8 scenarios verified
  ✓ Log Analysis: No warnings or errors found
  ✓ CI/CD: All checks passing

  Result: PASS — Ready for /cleanup-feature
  ```

#### Scenario: Mixed results
- **WHEN** some phases fail while others pass
- **THEN** the report SHALL show each phase result with failure details:
  ```
  Validation Report: <change-id>
  ✓ Deploy: Services started
  ✓ Smoke: All health checks passed
  ✗ E2E: 3/5 tests passed, 2 failures
    - test_login_flow: TimeoutError on /api/auth

  - **Staleness warnings**: For any report artifacts older than 7 days
  - **Recommendations**: Up to 5 suggested actions, selected by these rules in priority order: (1) if staleness warnings exist → "Refresh stale reports with /security-review or /refresh-architecture"; (2) if >5 test failures → "Fix failing tests before other fixes"; (3) if >10 lint findings → "Run /fix-scrub --tier auto for quick lint fixes"; (4) if deferred findings from >2 changes → "Consolidate deferred items into a follow-up proposal"; (5) if >20 findings total → "Consider running /fix-scrub --dry-run to preview remediation plan"

#### Scenario: Empty report

- **WHEN** no findings are discovered at or above the severity threshold
- **THEN** the report SHALL indicate a clean bill of health
- **AND** still include the staleness warnings section if applicable

### Requirement: Fix Scrub Remediation Skill

The system SHALL provide a `fix-scrub` skill that consumes the bug-scrub report and applies fixes with clean separation from the diagnostic phase. The skill classifies findings into three fixability tiers, applies fixes in parallel where safe, and verifies quality after changes.

The skill SHALL accept the following arguments:
- `--report <path>` (optional; default: `docs/bug-scrub/bug-scrub-report.json`)
- `--tier <list>` (optional; comma-separated tiers to apply; default: `auto,agent`; values: `auto`, `agent`, `manual`)
- `--severity <level>` (optional; minimum severity to fix; default: "medium")
- `--dry-run` (optional; plan fixes without applying them)
- `--max-agent-fixes <N>` (optional; limit agent-fix batch size; default: 10)

#### Scenario: Full fix-scrub run

- **WHEN** the user invokes `/fix-scrub`
- **THEN** the skill SHALL read the bug-scrub report from the default or specified path
- **AND** classify each finding into a fixability tier (auto, agent, manual)
- **AND** apply auto-fixes and agent-fixes for findings at or above the severity threshold
- **AND** run quality checks after all fixes
- **AND** commit the changes with a structured commit message
- **AND** report a summary of fixes applied, findings skipped, and manual-only items remaining

#### Scenario: Dry-run mode

- **WHEN** the user invokes `/fix-scrub --dry-run`
- **THEN** the skill SHALL classify all findings and produce a fix plan
- **AND** NOT apply any changes to the codebase
- **AND** report what would be fixed, by which tier, grouped by file scope

#### Scenario: No bug-scrub report found

- **WHEN** the user invokes `/fix-scrub` and no report exists at the expected path
- **THEN** the skill SHALL fail with a message recommending `/bug-scrub` be run first

#### Scenario: Bug-scrub report with missing or unknown fields

- **WHEN** the bug-scrub report JSON is missing expected fields or contains unknown fields
- **THEN** the skill SHALL treat missing fields as empty/default values
- **AND** ignore unknown fields
- **AND** log a warning suggesting the report may have been generated by a different version

### Requirement: Finding Fixability Classification

The fix-scrub skill SHALL classify each finding into one of three fixability tiers before applying fixes.

**Tier definitions:**
- **auto**: Tool-native auto-fix available (e.g., `ruff check --fix`, `ruff format`)
- **agent**: Requires code reasoning but has clear file scope (e.g., adding missing type annotations, resolving TODO markers, applying deferred patches)
- **manual**: Requires design decisions, cross-cutting changes, or human judgment (e.g., architecture issues, security findings, design-level deferred items)

#### Scenario: Auto-fixable classification

- **WHEN** a finding has source "ruff" and the rule supports `--fix`
- **THEN** the skill SHALL classify it as tier "auto"

#### Scenario: Agent-fixable classification

- **WHEN** a finding has source "mypy" (type error), or source "markers" where the marker text contains at least 10 characters after the keyword (sufficient context for an agent prompt), or source "deferred:impl-findings" where the finding includes a non-empty "Proposed Fix" or "Resolution" field
- **THEN** the skill SHALL classify it as tier "agent"

#### Scenario: Marker with insufficient context falls to manual

- **WHEN** a finding has source "markers" and the marker text contains fewer than 10 characters after the keyword (e.g., `# TODO` or `# FIXME: x`)
- **THEN** the skill SHALL classify it as tier "manual"

#### Scenario: Manual-only classification

- **WHEN** a finding has source "architecture" or source "security" or category "deferred-issue" without a clear proposed fix
- **THEN** the skill SHALL classify it as tier "manual"
- **AND** include it in the report as a manual action item

### Requirement: Auto-Fix Execution

- **AND** continue applying fixes in the existing worktree

### Requirement: Skill Script Path Resolution Convention

All SKILL.md files that reference co-located Python scripts SHALL use the `<agent-skills-dir>` placeholder convention to enable portable script resolution across agent runtimes.

Scripts are authored in `skills/<name>/scripts/` and distributed by `install.sh` to agent config directories (`.claude/skills/`, `.codex/skills/`, `.gemini/skills/`). Agents execute scripts from their own config directory, not from the `skills/` source.

#### Scenario: Script path placeholder in SKILL.md

- **THEN** it SHALL include a "Script Location" note explaining the convention and the substitution rule

### Requirement: Canonical Skill Distribution

Coordinator-integrated skill content SHALL be authored in the canonical `skills/` tree.

- **THEN** changes SHALL be applied to `skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`
- **AND** runtime mirror trees SHALL be updated by running `skills/install.sh --mode rsync --agents claude,codex,gemini`

#### Scenario: Runtime mirror drift is detected
- **WHEN** runtime mirror skills differ from canonical `skills/` after sync

### Requirement: Contract Revision Semantics

The system SHALL enforce contract revision tracking to prevent agents from working against stale contracts.

- Any contract file modification after implementation dispatch SHALL require a `contracts.revision` bump in `work-packages.yaml`.
- The orchestrator SHALL reject results whose `contracts_revision` does not match the current `work-packages.yaml` value.

- No modified file SHALL match any glob in `scope.deny`.
- Scope violations SHALL cause the package to fail with `error_code="SCOPE_VIOLATION"`.

#### Scenario: Agent modifies file within scope
- **WHEN** a work package agent modifies a file that matches `scope.write_allow` and does not match `scope.deny`
- **THEN** the scope check SHALL pass for that file

#### Scenario: Agent modifies file outside scope
- **WHEN** a work package agent modifies a file that does not match any `scope.write_allow` glob
- **THEN** the scope check SHALL fail
- **AND** the package SHALL report `error_code="SCOPE_VIOLATION"` with the violating file paths

### Requirement: Escalation Protocol

Work package executors SHALL signal structured escalations when they cannot complete correctly under current constraints.

- The orchestrator SHALL follow a deterministic decision procedure per escalation type.
- `BLOCKING` severity escalations SHALL trigger the pause-lock mechanism (`feature:<id>:pause`).

#### Scenario: Contract revision required escalation

- **AND** terminal 2 creates worktrees under `.git-worktrees/feature-b/`
- **AND** the shared checkout remains unchanged
- **AND** no git staging, branch switching, or file contention occurs between the two

- **AND** worktrees are removed from the registry

---

### Requirement: Agent Dispatch with Worktree Context

The orchestrator SHALL include worktree path and branch information in every parallel agent dispatch, and use vendor isolation when available as a safety net.

- **THEN** agent verifies `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` matches the expected worktree path
- **AND** agent verifies `git branch --show-current` matches the expected branch name
- **AND** if verification fails, agent reports error rather than proceeding in wrong directory

---

### Requirement: Integration Merge Protocol

After all parallel packages complete, an integration agent SHALL merge per-package branches into the feature branch with conflict detection.

- The integration agent SHALL run the full verification suite after merging all branches
- The integration agent SHALL operate in its own worktree (`--agent-id integrator`)

#### Scenario: Clean integration merge
- **WHEN** all 3 parallel packages complete with non-overlapping changes
- **THEN** integrator merges `openspec/add-auth/wp-backend`, `openspec/add-auth/wp-frontend`, `openspec/add-auth/wp-tests` into `openspec/add-auth`
- **AND** each merge uses `--no-ff` creating a merge commit

- THEN the command is `["codex", "exec", "-s", "read-only", "<prompt>"]`

#### Scenario: Alternative mode reads args from config

- GIVEN agents.yaml contains `gemini-local.cli.dispatch_modes.alternative.args: [--approval-mode, yolo]`
- WHEN the adapter builds the command for alternative mode
- THEN the command is `["gemini", "--approval-mode", "yolo", "<prompt>"]`

### Requirement: CLI Configuration Schema

Each agent entry in `agents.yaml` SHALL support an optional `cli` section with: `command` (binary name), `dispatch_modes` (map of mode name to args list), `model_flag` (flag syntax for model override), `model` (primary model or null), and `model_fallbacks` (ordered fallback list).

#### Scenario: Agent with no cli section

- GIVEN an agent entry in agents.yaml without a `cli` section
- WHEN the ReviewOrchestrator loads agent config
- THEN no adapter is created for that agent
- AND the agent is excluded from CLI dispatch (may still be available via other transports)

### Requirement: Non-Interactive Execution Guarantee

The `cli.dispatch_modes` config for each agent SHALL include non-interactive flags. The adapter enforces a hard timeout on every subprocess to catch misconfigured modes.

#### Scenario: Timeout kills hung process

- GIVEN a vendor process is dispatched with a 300-second timeout
- WHEN the process does not complete within 300 seconds
- THEN the dispatcher kills the process
- AND marks the result as timed out

### Requirement: Adapter Capability Check

The `CliVendorAdapter` SHALL implement a `can_dispatch(mode)` method that verifies: (1) the CLI binary exists on PATH, (2) the requested dispatch mode exists in `cli.dispatch_modes`.

#### Scenario: Missing CLI binary detected

- GIVEN the `codex` binary is not on PATH
- WHEN the adapter's `can_dispatch("review")` is called
- THEN it returns False
- AND the dispatcher skips this agent and proceeds with others

#### Scenario: Missing dispatch mode

- GIVEN an agent's cli config has no `alternative` dispatch mode
- WHEN `can_dispatch("alternative")` is called
- THEN it returns False

### Requirement: Model Fallback on Capacity Errors

When a vendor returns a 429 / MODEL_CAPACITY_EXHAUSTED error, the adapter SHALL retry with fallback models from the agent's `model_fallbacks` list in `agents.yaml` before marking the vendor as failed.

#### Scenario: Primary model exhausted, fallback succeeds

- GIVEN Gemini's configured model_fallbacks are `[gemini-2.5-pro, gemini-2.5-flash]`
- AND the primary model returns 429 RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED
- WHEN the adapter detects the capacity error in stderr
- THEN it retries with `-m gemini-2.5-pro` as the first fallback
- AND if the fallback succeeds, the findings are used normally

#### Scenario: All models exhausted

- GIVEN both primary and all fallback models return 429
- WHEN the adapter exhausts the fallback chain
- THEN the vendor is marked as failed with error details listing all models attempted
- AND the dispatcher proceeds with other available vendors

#### Scenario: No fallbacks configured

- GIVEN an agent entry with an empty `model_fallbacks` list
- WHEN the primary model returns 429
- THEN the vendor is marked as failed immediately (no retry)

### Requirement: Configurable Model Fallback Chains

Model fallback chains SHALL be configured per-agent in `agents.yaml` via `model` (primary, null for CLI default) and `model_fallbacks` (ordered list of fallback model names) fields. The adapter SHALL NOT hardcode model names.

#### Scenario: Read fallback config from agents.yaml

- GIVEN agents.yaml contains `model_fallbacks: [gemini-2.5-pro, gemini-2.5-flash]` for gemini-local
- WHEN the Gemini adapter initializes
- THEN it loads the fallback chain from the agent configuration
- AND uses these models in order when the primary model fails

### Requirement: Auth Error Surfacing

When a vendor fails due to authentication issues (expired token, missing login), the adapter SHALL surface a clear, actionable error message to the user with the vendor-specific re-login command.

#### Scenario: Gemini auth expired

- GIVEN Gemini returns a 401 UNAUTHENTICATED error
- WHEN the adapter parses the stderr
- THEN it prints a user-facing warning: "Gemini auth expired. Run: gemini login"
- AND the vendor is marked as failed (no retry, no fallback)

#### Scenario: Codex login required

- GIVEN Codex returns a login-required error
- WHEN the adapter parses the stderr
- THEN it prints a user-facing warning: "Codex login required. Run: codex login"
- AND the vendor is marked as failed (no retry, no fallback)

### Requirement: Review Manifest Generation

The review dispatcher SHALL produce a `reviews/review-manifest.json` file capturing dispatch metadata: which vendors were requested, which responded, timing, model used, quorum status, and error summaries for failed vendors.

#### Scenario: Manifest after mixed success

- GIVEN Codex review succeeded and Gemini review failed with 429
- WHEN the dispatcher completes
- THEN `reviews/review-manifest.json` contains entries for both vendors
- AND the Codex entry shows success=true with findings_count and elapsed_seconds
- AND the Gemini entry shows success=false with error_class="capacity_exhausted" and the models attempted

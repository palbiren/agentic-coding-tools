"""Scope overlap detection primitives.

Shared by ``validate_work_packages.py`` (parallel package validation)
and ``semantic_decomposer.py`` (Tier A deterministic dependency inference).

Provides pairwise overlap checks for write_allow globs, read_allow globs,
and lock keys.  All functions operate on plain lists/sets — they don't
know about ``RoadmapItem`` or ``WorkPackage`` dataclasses.
